print(2 + 2)            #Addition of integers
print(2.0 + 2.0)        #Addition of floats
print(2.0 + 26)         #You can add an integer and float together
print(3 * 9)            #Multiplication of integers
print(2.6 * 5.9)        #Multiplcation of floats
print(5 / 3)            #Simple division
print(5 // 3)           #Floor division. How many times can the right number go into the left.
print(6 // 3)
print(5 % 3)            #The modulo ('%') character. Gives the remainder of the left into right number. Three goes ito 5 with a reainder of 2.
print(6 % 2)
print(2 ** 3)           #Gives the exponential form of the function.
